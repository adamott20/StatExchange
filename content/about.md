StatExchange was started by five Brigham Young University statistics students as a side project to document what we do now and onward. The views expressed in this blog do not represent the views of Brigham Young University.

The theme for this blog was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme), previously modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium) and modified again by the contributors of this blog.
